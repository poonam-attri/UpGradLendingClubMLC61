## General Information
Lending Club is a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Lending loans to high risk customers may default in loan repayment default and it results in credit loss. It occurs when the borrower is unable to refuses to repay the loan amount. And lender wants to mitigate this risk by identifying high risk profiles to able to decide appropriately.

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to identify the factors which likely determine loan being fully paid or charged off and enable the lender to take informed decision.

## Data Available
The data given in the case study contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
-Most of the Lending Club's loan customers are employed for more than 10 years.

-Most Charged Off loans were issued in the year 2010-11.
There can be further enquiries into those two years' records.

-Most Charged Off loans are issued between 35-60 months of term.
Higher loan terms applications should be more scrutinized.

-Other than debt consolidation and Other purpose loans, Credit card purpose loans seem to be charged off more often followed Small business.
Hence, credit card and small business loan maybe charged with higher interest rates.

-Loan applicants living in rented or mortage homes tend to default more than others.
Hence, these applications may be requested to have collateral support to mitigate risk.

-State California(CA) have most loan charged off followed by Florida(FL) and New York(NY).
Loan applications in these states maybe charged with marginally higher interest rates then others.
